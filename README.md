#### An android application written in Java, that helps users select meals based on their personal preferences and nutritional requirements, offering tailored suggestions to support a balanced and healthy diet.
</div></h4>
Ever wanted to cook something or order takeout but couldnâ€™t decide what? Do the numerous choices modern society offers simply make things more difficult? <strong>Dishider</strong> has you covered. This app chooses a meal for you by taking into account your personal preferences, previously consumed meals, and even nutritional values and needs. Whether you're vegan, a health enthusiast, or just in the mood for a snack instead of a full meal, <strong>Dishider</strong> is the right application for you!

## Features

* What should I eat? With the press of a button, the application generates a ranked list of food options by taking into account (should the user wish);
  * Nutritional values from 6 distinct categories.
  * Meal type, by offering either snacks, full meals or both.
  * Vegan-friendly options.
  * History of previously consumed meals for increased variety.
* Nutrient Scores. With 6 distinct nutrient categories, the application will try to find meals that balance your scores near the middle. The chosen categories are; Fruits, Vegetables, Proteins, Sugars, Carbs and Fats. Consuming a meal dynamically alters these values and presents them to the user.
* Customisable meal list using Android's Room Database, allowing the user to expand the pre-existing list with new flavorful options. Added custom meals can as easily be removed.


## Future Work & Ideas

* Bluetooth capabilities for exchanging and sharing custom meals.
* Multiple Language support for world-wide accesibility.
* In-app achievements for a more fun and interactive usage.
* AI usage for estimating nutrient scores using pictures (or descriptions).
